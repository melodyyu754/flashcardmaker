# Java Arrays
- [[An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type]], referred to
  by a common name.
- In Java, arrays are objects, and must be created dynamically (at runtime).

## Declaring an Array
- [[General Form: type[] arrayName;]]
- ex: int[] myData;

- The above [[only creates a reference]] to an array object, but [[no array has
 actually been created yet]].
- [[What color is the sky?:::Blue]]

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- [[General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];]]
- ex: myData = new int[100]; [[What color is the sun?:::
Yellow]]

- Data types of the reference and array need to match.
- [[numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.]]
- [[What color is the grass?:::Green]]
- [[Gotcha: Array size is not
 modifiable once instantiated.]] [[Extra Important Info for Testing]]
