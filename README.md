## Introduction
This project contains two parts: a note summarizer and an Anki-like program that allows a user to make and practice flashcards using spaced repetition.

The note summarizer takes a folder of files, and picks out the .md files and pulls out only the important information, putting it into a new file. The flashcard maker allows a user to create a set of flashcards, and then practice those flashcards in the terminal. While practicing, a user can mark questions as hard or easy, which will change the order flashcards are practiced the next session.
